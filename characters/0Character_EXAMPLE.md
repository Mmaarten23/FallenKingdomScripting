## Background story
Mmaarten is a young king who took over the kingdom from his father after both his parents died on the battlefiled. All his life, Mmaarten had been a member of Iverus. Playing with the gates, messing with the secret passage ways, he needed to know the ins and outs of everything. How everything worked, why certain things do something in the way they do, Mmaarten would unveil all secrets. 
It is this curiosity that tought him important skills that he now needs as king. He can read his servants especially well and does everything he can to be the best king. 
His servants respect him for that.
